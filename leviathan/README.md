lolprodle API server - serves the backbone of lolprodle.com

## Models / API Endpoints

Up-to-date models and API endpoints can be viewed by running the server (`cargo run --features
swagger` - ensure you set the LOLPRODLE_CTX_DIR environment variable) and visiting the
`/swagger-ui/` endpoint (make sure you include the trailing slash ( **/** )!)
